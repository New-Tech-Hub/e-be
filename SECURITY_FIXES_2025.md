# Security Fixes Applied - October 2025

## Overview
This document details the security fixes applied to address three security findings identified in the comprehensive security review.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Performance Monitor Endpoint Authentication (Priority: Medium)

**Issue**: The `performance-monitor` edge function accepted unauthenticated requests, allowing anyone to insert performance metrics.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added JWT authentication check using `Authorization` header
- Validates user session before accepting performance data
- Uses service role only for database operations after auth verification
- Returns proper 401 responses for unauthenticated requests

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/functions/performance-monitor/index.ts`: Added authentication layer
- `src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitor.tsx`: Updated to send auth token with requests

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents unauthorized metric insertion
- Protects against DoS attacks via database flooding
- Ensures metric data integrity
- Rate limiting inherited from authenticated requests

### 2. XSS Prevention in Chart Component (Priority: Medium)

**Issue**: `ChartStyle` component used `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with dynamic CSS values without sanitization, creating potential XSS vulnerability if chart config contained malicious data.

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented `sanitizeCssColor()` function to validate and sanitize CSS color values
- Whitelisted safe color formats: hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, CSS color names
- Sanitized chart IDs and keys to prevent CSS injection
- Removed dangerous characters: `<>{};"'`
- Added console warnings for blocked unsafe values

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`: Added input validation and sanitization

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents CSS injection attacks
- Blocks XSS via malicious color values
- Maintains functionality while enforcing security
- Defense-in-depth even if config sources change

---

### 3. Verbose Error Logging in Edge Functions (Priority: Low)

**Issue**: Edge functions exposed detailed error information via `console.error` and error responses, potentially leaking implementation details.

**Fix Applied**:
- Sanitized error messages to remove technical details
- Kept detailed logging only in server-side logs (console)
- Return generic error messages to clients
- Maintained error context for debugging without exposing to users

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/functions/performance-monitor/index.ts`: Generic client errors
- `supabase/functions/maps-proxy/index.ts`: Sanitized error responses
- `src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitor.tsx`: Conditional error logging (dev only)

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents information disclosure
- Reduces attack surface by hiding implementation details
- Maintains debugging capability in development
- Professional error handling for production

## Testing Checklist

### Performance Monitor Authentication
- [ ] Verify authenticated users can submit metrics
- [ ] Verify unauthenticated requests receive 401
- [ ] Verify metrics are properly stored with user context
- [ ] Check edge function logs for auth validation

### Chart Component XSS Prevention
- [ ] Test with valid color formats (hex, rgb, hsl)
- [ ] Attempt injection with malicious CSS values
- [ ] Verify console warnings for blocked values
- [ ] Check chart rendering with various configs

### Error Logging
- [ ] Verify production error messages are generic
- [ ] Check server logs contain detailed error info
- [ ] Test development mode shows detailed errors
- [ ] Validate error responses don't leak implementation details

---

## Security Posture Summary

All three identified security issues have been resolved:

✅ **Performance Monitor**: Now requires authentication  
✅ **Chart XSS**: Input validation and sanitization implemented  
✅ **Error Logging**: Sanitized for production environments

**Current Security Status**: Strong  
**Risk Level**: Low  
**Recommended Actions**: Regular security audits, monitor for new vulnerabilities

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review edge function logs for suspicious activity
- **Monthly**: Security scan of dependencies
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive security audit

### Monitoring
Monitor the following for potential security concerns:
- Unauthorized authentication attempts on performance-monitor
- Console warnings about blocked color values in charts
- Error rate spikes in edge functions
