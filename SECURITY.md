# 🔒 Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Ebeth Boutique application to protect customer data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with security best practices.

---

## ✅ Implemented Security Measures

### 1. **Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies**

All database tables have been secured with strict RLS policies:

#### **Profiles Table**
- ✅ Users can only view and modify their own profile data
- ✅ Super admins have audited access to all profiles
- ✅ Input validation prevents SQL injection and data corruption
- ✅ Field length limits enforced (names, phones, addresses)
- ✅ Whitespace trimming for all text fields

#### **Orders Table**
- ✅ Users can only view their own orders
- ✅ Super admins can view/update all orders
- ✅ Order deletion restricted to super admins only
- ✅ Admin access is fully logged for audit trails
- ✅ Shipping address data protected

#### **Cart & Wishlist Tables**
- ✅ Split policies with explicit WITH CHECK conditions
- ✅ Users cannot modify other users' carts or wishlists
- ✅ Validation triggers prevent data manipulation
- ✅ Cart quantity limits enforced (1-999 items)
- ✅ Duplicate wishlist items prevented

#### **Discount Coupons**
- ✅ No public access to coupon database
- ✅ Rate-limited validation (10 attempts per minute)
- ✅ All validation attempts logged
- ✅ Only active, valid coupons returned
- ✅ Super admins have full coupon management access

#### **Role Hierarchy**
- ✅ Restricted to super admins only
- ✅ Prevents privilege escalation attacks
- ✅ Role changes are audited and logged

#### **Delivery Slots**
- ✅ Restricted to authenticated users only
- ✅ Prevents competitors from analyzing capacity

---

### 2. **Secure Database Functions**

#### **validate_coupon_code(coupon_code text)**
- **Purpose**: Secure coupon validation without exposing full database
- **Security Features**:
  - Requires authentication
  - Rate limiting (10 validations per minute)
  - All attempts logged
  - Only returns valid, active coupons
  - Prevents coupon harvesting

#### **admin_access_profile(target_user_id uuid, reason text)**
- **Purpose**: Audited admin access to customer profiles
- **Security Features**:
  - Super admin verification
  - Full audit logging with context
  - Explicit reason required
  - Tamper-proof access trail

#### **admin_access_order(target_order_id uuid, reason text)**
- **Purpose**: Audited admin access to customer orders
- **Security Features**:
  - Super admin verification
  - Full audit logging
  - Shipping address access tracked

#### **get_public_profile_info(target_user_id uuid)**
- **Purpose**: Safe retrieval of non-sensitive profile data
- **Security Features**:
  - Returns only public fields (name, city, state, country)
  - Excludes sensitive data (phone, address)
  - Used for public display (reviews, etc.)

---

### 3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**

#### **Profile Data Validation**
```sql
- Phone number: max 20 characters
- Full name: max 200 characters
- Address: max 500 characters
- Automatic whitespace trimming
- Prevents malicious input
```

#### **Cart Item Validation**
```sql
- Quantity: 1-999 items
- User ID verification on all operations
- Prevents cart manipulation attacks
```

#### **Wishlist Validation**
```sql
- Duplicate prevention
- User ID verification
- Prevents wishlist manipulation
```

---

### 4. **Security Audit Logging**

All sensitive operations are logged to `security_audit_log` table:
- ✅ Admin profile access
- ✅ Admin order access
- ✅ Coupon validation attempts
- ✅ Role changes
- ✅ Profile updates
- ✅ Timestamps and user context

#### Audit Log Structure
```sql
- user_id: Who performed the action
- action: What they did
- table_name: Which table was affected
- record_id: Which record was accessed
- details: Full context in JSON format
- ip_address: Network information (optional)
- user_agent: Browser/client information (optional)
```

---

### 5. **Rate Limiting**

Implemented on security-sensitive functions:
- ✅ Coupon validation: 10 attempts per minute
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of old rate limit records
- ✅ Prevents brute force attacks
- ✅ Prevents system abuse

---

### 6. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

#### Role Hierarchy
1. **Super Admin** (jerryguma01@gmail.com)
   - Full system access
   - Can manage all data
   - Can assign any role
   - All actions are logged

2. **Admin**
   - Manage products, categories, orders
   - Cannot modify super admin
   - Limited user management

3. **Manager**
   - View orders and products
   - Limited modification rights

4. **Customer**
   - Standard user access
   - Own data only

#### Role Protection
- ✅ Users cannot change their own role
- ✅ Privilege escalation prevented
- ✅ Role changes are validated and logged
- ✅ Super admin status verified by email + role

---

### 7. **Data Protection Best Practices**

#### **Encryption**
- ✅ All data encrypted at rest (Supabase default)
- ✅ TLS/SSL for data in transit
- ✅ Supabase connection encrypted

#### **Access Control**
- ✅ Principle of least privilege
- ✅ No public data exposure
- ✅ Authentication required for all sensitive operations

#### **Data Minimization**
- ✅ Only collect necessary information
- ✅ Sensitive data access logged
- ✅ Public functions return limited fields

## ⚠️ Action Required: Password Security

### Enable Leaked Password Protection

**Status**: ⚠️ Not Enabled (Requires Manual Setup)

**Why It Matters**: 
Leaked password protection prevents users from using passwords that have been exposed in data breaches. This significantly reduces the risk of credential stuffing attacks.

**How to Enable**:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Policies** → **Password**
3. Enable: **"Check for leaked passwords"**
4. Configure password strength requirements

WHERE action LIKE 'admin_%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### View Coupon Validation Attempts
```sql
SELECT * FROM security_audit_log
WHERE action = 'coupon_validation_attempt'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### View Role Changes
```sql
SELECT * FROM security_audit_log
WHERE action = 'profile_updated'
AND details->>'old_role' != details->>'new_role'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Rate Limit Monitoring
```sql
SELECT user_id, function_name, COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM security_rate_limits
WHERE window_start > now() - interval '1 hour'
GROUP BY user_id, function_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

## ✨ Best Practices for Developers

### When Adding New Features

1. **Always Enable RLS**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **Create Specific Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Bad: Using ALL
   CREATE POLICY "manage" ON table FOR ALL USING (...);
   
   -- Good: Specific operations
   CREATE POLICY "select" ON table FOR SELECT USING (...);
   CREATE POLICY "insert" ON table FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (...);
   ```

3. **Validate Input**
   - Always create validation triggers
   - Check data types and lengths
   - Sanitize user input

4. **Log Sensitive Operations**
   ```sql
   PERFORM public.log_security_event(
     'action_name',
     'table_name',
     record_id,
     jsonb_build_object('context', 'data')
   );
   ```

5. **Use Security Definer Carefully**
   - Always set `search_path`
   - Verify user permissions
   - Log access attempts
