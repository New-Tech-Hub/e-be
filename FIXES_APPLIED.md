# Fixes Applied - October 21, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Blank Page/App Crash Issue
**Problem**: App was showing blank page due to `OptimizedImage` component crash
**Root Cause**: The component was calling `.includes()` on image imports that return objects, not strings
**Fix**: 
- Updated `OptimizedImage.tsx` to handle both string URLs and image objects from ES6 imports
- Added `getImageSrc()` helper function to properly extract image URLs
- Added proper TypeScript type handling

### 2. ✅ fetchPriority React Warning
**Problem**: React doesn't recognize `fetchPriority` prop (should be camelCase in React)
**Fix**: Changed to conditional prop spreading: `{...(priority && { fetchPriority: "high" as const })}`
**Result**: No more console warnings about unknown DOM properties

### 3. ✅ Analytics RLS Policy Errors
**Problem**: Analytics tracking failed for unauthenticated users
**Fix**: 
- Added authentication check before tracking events
- Only track analytics when `user?.id` exists
- Maintains silent failure for better UX
**Result**: No more RLS policy violation errors

### 4. ✅ React Router Future Flag Warnings
**Problem**: Deprecation warnings about v7 route resolution
**Fix**: Added future flags to BrowserRouter: `v7_relativeSplatPath` and `v7_startTransition`
**Result**: Future-proof routing configuration

### 5. ✅ Image Loading Fixed
**Problem**: Hero carousel and all imported images working correctly
**Status**: All images loading properly across the site
- Hero carousel images ✅
- Category images ✅
- Product images ✅
- Logo and avatar images ✅
