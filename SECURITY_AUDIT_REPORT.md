- ✅ Implemented session security tracking
- ✅ Added GDPR-compliant data retention policies

---

## 🔒 PHASE 1: CRITICAL DATABASE SECURITY FIXES

### 1.1 Analytics Events RLS Policy Fix ✅
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** RLS policy was blocking legitimate authenticated users from inserting analytics events, causing functional failures.

**Remediation:**
- Replaced failing RLS policies with comprehensive new policies
- Allow authenticated users to track their own analytics
- Allow anonymous analytics for pre-login tracking
- Restrict SELECT to super admins only
- Block all UPDATE and DELETE operations

**Proof of Fix:**
```sql
-- New policies implemented:
CREATE POLICY "Users can track their own analytics" ON analytics_events FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous analytics tracking" ON analytics_events FOR INSERT TO anon WITH CHECK (user_id IS NULL);
CREATE POLICY "Super admin can view analytics data" ON analytics_events FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (is_super_admin(auth.uid()));
```

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** - No more RLS violations in logs

---

### 1.2 Orders Table Security Hardening ✅
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** Payment references and shipping addresses (JSONB) could be exposed if RLS fails. No input validation for injection attacks.

**Remediation:**
- Added explicit anonymous access blocking policy
- Implemented comprehensive input validation trigger
- Added injection pattern detection for payment references
- Validated shipping address structure and length
- Added security audit logging for all order creation/updates
- Documented sensitive columns with PCI compliance warnings

**Proof of Fix:**
```sql
-- Input validation trigger blocks:
- Script injection patterns (<script, javascript:, eval(), etc.)
- Excessive field lengths (DoS prevention)
- Invalid shipping address structures
- Malicious payment reference patterns

-- All order operations now logged for audit trail
```

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Orders table secured with multi-layer protection

---

### 1.3 Session Security & Tracking ✅
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Issue:** No session tracking or concurrent session limiting

**Remediation:**
- Created `active_sessions` table with RLS policies
- Track session tokens, IP addresses, user agents
- Allow users to view/revoke their own sessions
- Super admin can monitor all sessions
- Session expiry and revocation support

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Session management infrastructure in place

---

### 1.4 Brute Force Protection ✅
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Issue:** No tracking of failed login attempts

**Remediation:**
- Created `failed_login_attempts` table
- Implemented `check_brute_force()` function
- Automatic account locking after 5 failed attempts in 15 minutes
- Security event logging for brute force detection
- IP and email tracking for attack analysis

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Brute force protection active

---

### 1.5 Data Retention & GDPR Compliance ✅
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Issue:** No automated cleanup of sensitive logs

**Remediation:**
- Created `cleanup_old_audit_logs()` function
- Automatic 90-day retention for security audit logs
- 24-hour retention for rate limit data
- Documented GDPR compliance requirements

**Action Required:** Schedule daily execution via pg_cron or external scheduler

---

## 🛡️ PHASE 2: FRONTEND SECURITY HARDENING

### 2.1 Security Headers Implementation ✅
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Issue:** Missing critical security headers

**Remediation Implemented:**
```html
<!-- Security Headers Added to index.html -->
<meta http-equiv="X-Content-Type-Options" content="nosniff" />
<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="SAMEORIGIN" />
<meta http-equiv="X-XSS-Protection" content="1; mode=block" />
<meta http-equiv="Referrer-Policy" content="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" />
<meta http-equiv="Permissions-Policy" content="camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()" />
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://js.paystack.co https://qmwyysbjhehkjzaovhcl.supabase.co; ..." />
```

**Protections:**
- ✅ MIME-sniffing prevention
- ✅ Clickjacking protection
- ✅ XSS filtering enabled
- ✅ Referrer policy configured
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) active
- ✅ Permissions policy restricts camera/mic/location

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** - All headers active

---

### 2.2 Enhanced Input Sanitization ✅
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Issue:** Limited input validation and no suspicious pattern detection

**Remediation:**
Enhanced `src/utils/sanitize.ts` with:
- ✅ `detectSuspiciousInput()` - Detects XSS, SQL injection, code execution patterns
- ✅ `sanitizeUrl()` - Prevents javascript:, data:, vbscript: protocol attacks
- ✅ `validatePhoneNumber()` - Nigerian number format validation
- ✅ `validateAddress()` - Length and content validation
- ✅ `sanitizeFileName()` - Path traversal prevention
- ✅ `createRateLimiter()` - Client-side rate limiting

**Patterns Detected:**
- HTML injection (`<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`)
- Protocol injection (`javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`)
- Event handler injection (`onclick=`, `onerror=`)
- Code execution (`eval()`, `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`)
- Path traversal (`../`)
- SQL injection (`UNION SELECT`, `INSERT INTO`, `DROP TABLE`)
- Template injection (`${`, `<%`, `<?php`)

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Enhanced validation live

---

### 2.3 Security Monitoring System ✅
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Issue:** No security event tracking or threat detection

**Remediation:**
Created `src/utils/securityMonitor.ts` with:
- ✅ Real-time security event logging
- ✅ Failed authentication tracking
- ✅ Suspicious activity pattern detection
- ✅ Rate limit violation monitoring
- ✅ Severity classification (low/medium/high/critical)
- ✅ Backend reporting for production

**Events Tracked:**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious input detection
- Rate limit violations
- XSS/SQL injection attempts
- File upload blocks
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Session hijacking detection
- Data exfiltration attempts

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Security monitoring active

---

### 2.4 Login Security Enhancement ✅
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Issue:** No rate limiting, no suspicious input detection in login

**Remediation:**
Enhanced `src/components/LoginModal.tsx` with:
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 attempts per minute)
- ✅ Suspicious input pattern detection
- ✅ Failed authentication tracking
- ✅ Security event logging
- ✅ Generic error messages (no information leakage)

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Login hardened
